LockedMe program enables user to perform basic file operations on files/folder present in directory. 

Programming Language: Java

With the command line interface user will get a main menu option upon running the Java program. This main menu displays 3 options as in to, 
1.	Display the files/folders in existing directory
2.	Add/delete/search files 
3.	Exit or close the program

Upon selecting an option from main menu, user can further continue or exit the program.
By selecting option 2 from main menu, user will get an output displaying submenu option which mainly,

1.	Add new file in current directory
2.	Delete existing file
3.	Search for a file
4.	To go back to main menu
User will receive error/success message upon these file operations. Exceptions are handled using try and catch blocks. This is done as to avoid program to function abnormally.
